# Lesson 1: 

# What is a Singly Linked List?

- A data structure the contains a *head*, *tail* and *length* property. 
- Linked Lists consist of *nodes*.
- In a singly linked list, each node has a *value* and a *pointer* to another node or if it is at the very end, to _null_.
- There is no indexes.

A visual example would be: an elevator vs stairs.
- in an array you can take the elevator to the n index (floor).
- in a list you have to take the stairs to the n floor.

# Comparison of Linked Lists with Arrays

## LISTS:
- Do not have indexes.
- Connect via nodes with a *next* pointer.

- PRO : Effective insertion and deletion at the begining and end of the list.
- CON : Random access is not possible.

## ARRAYS:
- Indexed in order.
- CON : Insertion and delition can be _expensive_.
- PRO : Can quickly be accesed at a specific index.
